# Semantic Markup Code Refactor

## Description

This was project was a challenge assigned to us where we had to refactor the code of a website in order to make it more semantic. I ran into a lot of issues trying to change the structure of the HTML because it would unlink the CSS selectors, but also the CSS was not consolidated or organized in a way that made sense. In the end, the website's code follows a much more understandable structure if it were to be looked at by another person and needed to be updated. The project helped me learn more about how CSS can be linked to HTML elements and how small changes can create bugs that you have to continuously check, but that is also why it is important to save your work and make detailed commits often.



## Usage

This project serves as an example website after the code was refactored to be more semantic and does not function as full site of a business.
